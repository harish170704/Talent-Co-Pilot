# Talent Co-Pilot

Talent Co-Pilot is an **AI-powered talent recommendation assistant** that helps Project Managers quickly identify the best employees for new projects. Instead of manually checking spreadsheets or asking internal referrals, the manager simply **describes the project in natural language**, and the system uses the **Gemini AI API** to suggest the most suitable employees with clear reasoning.

This project is **frontend-only** and does **not use any backend or database**. Employee data is stored in a local `data.json` file and processed through Gemini for analysis and recommendations.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Project Managers often face challenges such as:

- Manually searching for employees with the right skills
- Bias based on familiarity or limited knowledge of talent pool
- Difficulty matching projects with employee growth aspirations
- Time pressure during staffing decisions

**Talent Co-Pilot** makes this process faster, fairer, and more transparent by turning staffing into a simple AI-assisted workflow.

## 🖼️ Example Recommendation Output

When the user enters a project requirement like:

> _"Need a Senior Python engineer with AWS experience to lead a data migration project."_

The system might return:

| Name | Role | Match Score | Reasoning | Growth Alignment |
|------|------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Ayesha Verma** | Senior Cloud Engineer | **92%** | Strong match on Python, AWS, CI/CD pipelines | Opportunity to mentor junior engineers, aligns with her career goal to lead teams |
| **Rahul Sharma** | Data Engineer | **85%** | Skilled in Python + ETL + Airflow; partial AWS experience | Good stepping-stone toward Senior Cloud role |
| **Priya Nair** | Machine Learning Engineer | **77%** | Python expert, moderate cloud exposure | Good stretch role for cloud upskilling |

Each recommendation includes:
- **Match score** (how closely their skills align)
- **Why they fit** (key overlapping skills)
- **Growth support** (respects employee aspirations)

This ensures staffing decisions are:
- **Transparent**
- **Fair**
- **Human-centered**
